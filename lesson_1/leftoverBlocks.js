/*
You have a number of building blocks that can be used to build a valid structure. There are certain rules about 
what determines the validity of a structure:

-The building blocks are cubes
-The structure is built in layers
-The top layer is a single block
-A block in an upper layer must be supported by four blocks in a lower layer
-A block in a lower layer can support more than one block in an upper layer
-You cannot leave gaps between blocks

Write a program that, given the number for a specific amount of cubes, calculates the number of blocks left over
after building the tallest possible valid structure.

You are provided with the problem description above. Your tasks for this step are:

- To make notes of your mental model for the problem, including explicit and implicit rules
- Write a list of questions for things that aren't clear about the problem from the description provided
